"As a Chinese saying goes, 'A mountain is formed by accumulation of earth and an ocean is formed by accumulation of water.' Happiness and a bright future will not appear automatically," Xi said.

“正如一句中国谚语所说：’积土方成高山，积水而成汪洋‘。幸福和美好的未来从不会无故显现。” 习主席说到。

Xi was sent to Liangjiahe, a small, isolated village in Shaanxi province, and stayed for seven years, where he lived in yaodong, or cave houses, and worked alongside farmers.

习近平来到陕西省偏远的小村庄梁家河，在这里度过了7个春夏秋冬。他晚上住窑洞或山洞，白天与农民一起劳作。

In an interview with China Central Television in 2003, Xi recalled his early life at Liangjiahe, saying that he had done all kinds of farm work there, including herding sheep.

习主席在2003年接受中国中央电视台的采访时回忆起早期在梁家河的生活：他在那儿做过各种农活，还放过羊。

"At that time I could carry 200 jin (100 kilograms) of wheat on my shoulder, and I could do it for 10 li (5 kilometers) on a mountainous road without switching it between shoulders," he told CCTV.

他告诉央视：“ 那时候我肩上能挑起200斤（100千克）的小麦走10里（5公里）山路都不用换肩休息。”

Liu Jinlian, a Liangjiahe villager who had provided a cave house to Xi, recalled in a book published last year that no matter how tired Xi was, he would never rest if the farm work was not done.

梁家河的一位村民刘金莲曾经给习主席提供窑洞居住。她回忆道，不论习主席多么劳累，只要农活没干完，他就不休息。刘金莲在去年出版的一本习主席回忆录中提到。

 'Jinping comes from a big city, but he works as hard as us villagers. He has knowledge, loves studying and withstands difficulties. He is amazing',"

“近平是大城市来的，但他和我们村里人一样努力干活。他有知识，喜爱读书学习又能克服艰难。
